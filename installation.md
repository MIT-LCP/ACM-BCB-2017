## Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and conda (new users)

The workshop tutorials are provided as Jupyter Notebooks, which are executable documents containing both code and documentation. To use these tutorials you will first need to install Jupyter. 

For new users of Jupyter, we recommend installing Anaconda. Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

Use the following installation steps:

1. Download Anaconda. We recommend downloading Anaconda’s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.5).

2. Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook:

`jupyter notebook`

## Installing Jupyter with pip (experienced users)

As an existing Python user, you may wish to install Jupyter using Python’s package manager, pip, instead of Anaconda.

First, ensure that you have the latest pip; older versions may have trouble with some dependencies:

`pip3 install --upgrade pip`

Then install the Jupyter Notebook using:

`pip3 install jupyter`

    "* Congestive heart failure is a common illness for ICU patients, but the severity of the illness can vary substantially. Are there distinct subgroups among patients admitted with congestive heart failure? For example, are patients with preserved ejection fraction substantially different than those without?\n",
    "* Sepsis is a life-threatening condition usually associated with infection - but little research investigates how septic patients vary based on the source of the infection. As APACHE diagnoses are organ specific (e.g. `SEPSISPULM`, `SEPSISGI`, `SEPSISUTI`), can we find any substantial differences among septic patients based upon the initial location of the infection?\n",
    "* Lab measurements take up to 6 hours to measure and can be costly. Can we predict a future lab measurement based upon previous measures and simultaneous non-invasive measurements?\n",
    "* Dialysis is a major intervention provided in the ICU, and it serves to replace the function of the kidneys (cleaning the blood). Can we predict if a patient will receive dialysis from physiology?\n",
    "* Mechanical ventilation is a similar treatment used to replace the function of the lungs. This intervention eases the work of the breathing, allowing the patient's own lungs to heal. However, knowing when to cease mechanical ventilation (extubate) is an open problem, and clinicians largely utilize a \"try and see\" approach. Can we predict future extubation from the patient's current data?\n",
    "* Missing data is extremely common in clinical data. Measurements are sparse, noisy, irregularly sampled, and not missing at random. Gaussian Processes are an elegant technique for handling difficult data scenarious such as this. As many algorithms require complete data, techniques to impute realistic values for missing data are increasingly relevant. Can we use a Gaussian Process to estimate the trajectory of physiologic data and as a generative model for imputing missing data?"
